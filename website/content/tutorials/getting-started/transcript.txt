Hi and welcome to vector js

In this tutorial we are going to create a simple interactive using the vector js library

First navigate the the website vectorjs.org

Download the getting started tar ball

Open the zipped file to get a directory containing an index.html file and script.js file.

The HTML file links the library's style sheet,

has an element with an unique id,

and includes the script file

Serve this HTML file with a local server using Web Server for Chrome

Select the getting-started directory

The result is a simple interactive with a draggable control point
