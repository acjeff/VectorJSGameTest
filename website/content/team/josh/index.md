I am 23 years old and graduating this semester with a degree in Computer Science. Some of my favorite hobbies are video games, puzzles, and running. My academic interests outside of computing include sociology, art, and world religion. My interest in this project comes from creating geographic weather interactives, and seeing how challening it was to use existing tools.
