I am a senior in the combined BS/MS computer science program and will graduate in Spring 2021. I am currently interested in research opportunities and hope to continue my education after graduating by participating in a PhD program. I am especially interested in data visualization and am a part of the <a href="https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/" target="_blank" rel="nonoreferrer">Visualization Design Lab</a> here at Utah.
